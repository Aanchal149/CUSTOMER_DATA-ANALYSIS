# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis Using Probability

This project analyzes customer purchase behavior using **Probability**, **Random Variables**, and **Joint Probability** concepts across three platforms:**Excel**, and **Python**.

## Objective

To apply foundational probability and statistics concepts to a real-world dataset. This includes:
- Calculating basic and conditional probabilities
- Deriving expected values
- Creating probability distributions
- Analyzing trends in customer behavior and purchase methods

## Files Included

- üìÑ `Assignment 1 - FDS (2).pdf`: Problem statement and guidelines
- üìä `EXCELFILEASSGINMENT.xlsx`: Excel solution with formulas and visualizations
- üêç `purchase_analysis.py` or `purchase_analysis.ipynb`: Python code for analysis and visualization

## Concepts Applied

- **Basic Probability**: Likelihood of purchasing each product category
- **Expected Value**: Calculated expected purchase amount
- **Spending Behavior Distribution**: Probability across spending bins
- **Joint Probability**: Product category and payment method combinations
- **Conditional Probability**: Payment method given product category


## Tools Used

- **Excel**: Data handling, pivot tables, charts
- **Python**: Data analysis using `pandas`, visualizations with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`


## Visualizations (Python)

- **Monthly Sales Trends** (Bar Chart)
- **Category-Wise Revenue** (Pie Chart)
- **Payment Method Trends** (Stacked Bar)
- **Spending Pattern** (Box Plot)
- **Joint Probability** (Heatmap)
- **Customer Purchase Frequency** (Histogram)


## Trend Analysis

- **Time-Based Trends**: Monthly and daily sales
- **Customer Behavior**: Frequency and average spend
- **Spending Categories**: "0-50","50-100","100-200","200+" bins


## How to Run (Python)

```bash
# Install required libraries
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

# Run the script or open Jupyter notebook
python purchase_analysis.py
# or
jupyter notebook purchase_analysis.ipynb
